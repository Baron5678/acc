Compilation (Linux/MacOS or Windows PowerShell with MinGW):

1. Compiling Graph Generator
g++ ./Source/main_generator.cpp ./Source/GraphGenerator.cpp -std=c++17 -O2 -static -static-libgcc -static-libstdc++ -o ./Exe/MainGenerator.exe
2. Compiling Graph Minimum Extension Program
g++ ./Source/main_solver.cpp ./Source/HungarianAlgorithm.cpp ./Source/Graph.cpp -std=c++17 -O2 -static -static-libgcc -static-libstdc++ -o ./Exe/MainResolver.exe

In Windows CMD, you must replace slashes with backslashes:

1. Compiling Graph Generator
g++ .\Source\main_generator.cpp .\Source\GraphGenerator.cpp -std=c++17 -O2 -static -static-libgcc -static-libstdc++ -o .\Exe\MainGenerator.exe
2. Compiling Graph Minimum Extension Program
g++ .\Source\main_solver.cpp .\Source\HungarianAlgorithm.cpp .\Source\Graph.cpp -std=c++17 -O2 -static -static-libgcc -static-libstdc++ -o .\Exe\MainResolver.exe

On Linux or MacOS, if you have problems compiling, omit the "-static -static-libgcc -static-libstdc++" flags.

For running the program:

Use an input file in the following format:

n
x_1,1 x_1,2 ... x_1,n
x_2,1 x_2,2 ... x_2,n
...    ...  ...  ...
x_n,1 x_n,2 ... x_n,n
m
y_1,1 y_1,2 ... y_1,m
y_2,1 y_2,2 ... y_2,m
...    ...  ...  ...
y_m,1 y_m,2 ... y_m,m

Where n,m are the sizes of the adjacency matrices of graphs H and G respectively, and x_i,j, y_i,j are either 1 or 0 (edge or no edge) values of the respective adjacency matrices, and n >= m.

Four example files in the format are provided in ./Example/Graph{i}.txt, i >= 1, i <= 7.

The general form for running the minimum extension of a subgraph of H for isomorphism with G and visualizing the results is as follows:

./Exe/MainResolver.exe <hungarian|exact> ./path/to/graphs/file.txt <integer: no. isomorphisms>

or in Windows CMD (backslashes instead of slashes):

.\Exe\MainResolver.exe <hungarian|exact> .\path\to\graphs\file.txt <integer: no. isomorphisms>

Where "exact" checks all possible mappings and picks the best one, and "hungarian" computes an optimized mapping by solving an assignment problem to minimize cost (Kuhn-Munkres algorithm), which approximates the best mapping.

To compute the exact minimum extension of a sugraph of H for isomorphism with G and visualize the change:
./Exe/MainResolver.exe exact ./Examples/Graph1.txt 1

or in Windows CMD (backslashes instead of slashes):
.\Exe\MainResolver.exe exact .\Examples\Graph1.txt 1

To compute the approximation of the minimum extension of a subgraph H for isomorphism with G using the hungarian algorithm and visualize the change of the adjacency matrix:
./Exe/MainResolver.exe hungarian ./Examples/Graph1.txt 1

or in Windows CMD (backslashes instead of slashes):
.\Exe\MainResolver.exe hungarian .\Examples\Graph1.txt 1

To try to find n minimum extension isomorphisms with the approximation and visualize the change of the adjacency matrix:
./Exe/MainResolver.exe hungarian ./Examples/Graph1.txt n

or in Windows CMD (backslashes instead of slashes):
.\Exe\MainResolver.exe hungarian .\Examples\Graph1.txt n

To try to find a maximum amount of minimum extension isomorphisms with the approximation:
./Exe/MainResolver.exe hungarian ./Examples/Graph1.txt -1

or in Windows CMD (backslashes instead of slashes):
.\Exe\MainResolver.exe hungarian .\Examples\Graph1.txt -1

To generate random graphs G (pattern) and H (target) and save them to a file (`graphs.txt`) use:
./Exe/MainGenerator.exe {size V(G)} {size V(H)}

or in Windows CMD (backslashes instead of slashes):
.\Exe\MainGenerator.exe {size V(G)} {size V(H)}

Both arguments are optional — if omitted the defaults are `V(G)=5` and `V(H)=8`. The program seeds the random number generator with the current time, so output differs between runs. Densities used by the generator are set in the program (default: density_G = 0.8 for G and density_H = 0.3 for H). The generated graphs are written as adjacency matrices to `graphs.txt` (first the size and matrix for G, then the size and matrix for H). If you specify a target H smaller than pattern G the program will print a warning.
